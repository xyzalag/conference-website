                <p class="guest__description" style="margin-bottom: 2rem">
                    <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> <br>
                    It has been traditionally thought that attention to objects leads to
                    their semantic processing and ulterior access to consciousness and later
                    memory retrieval. This would be the “attention leading to semantic
                    processing” hypothesis.  In the current talk, however, I will show
                    evidence supporting an alternative “semantic processing leading to
                    attention” hypothesis.  I will describe data from several experiments
                    using a change detection paradigm, in which we manipulated the semantic
                    congruity between the to-be-detected object and the background scene,
                    showing that attentional capture by incongruent semantic processing can
                    occur before the objects are consciously detected. Object-context
                    semantic congruity affects objects’ detection, identification and later
                    memory. I will describe the role of TPJ in establishing the semantic
                    context over which congruent objects are more difficult to detect but
                    more easily identified and later remembered.

He is currently Full Professor of Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Granada, where he is the director of the Cognitive Neuroscience research group. He is currently president of the Spanish Society of Experimental Psychology (SEPEX). Most of his research deals with different aspects of Cognitive Neuroscience in general, and in particular with Attention and its relation to other processes such as Emotion, Learning and Memory, Spatial Processing and Consciousness.</p>

He is currently an associate professor at the University of Twente (Netherlands) as well as a visiting professor at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań (Poland). In his scientific research his main focus revolves around psychophysics, psychophysiology and cognitive psychology especially neuronal correlates of spatial attention as well as the influence of attention and focus on stimuli processing. </p>

                <p class="guest__description">Professor Francesco Battaglia is an associate professor at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmengen, Neatherlands. His work has concentrated on neural ensemble recordings in freely behaving rodents (rats and mice), with which we can record up to ~100 single neurons. He focused on the interaction between hippocampus and neocortex, in memory encoding and consolidation. He developed data analysis techniques to detect the activation of synchronized neuronal groups ('cell assemblies'). In mice, we are currently studying the behavior of hippocampal place cells and hippocampal oscillatory dynamics in several transgenic models of impaired synaptic function (NMDA CA1 KO, developed in S. Tonegawa’s lab at the MIT) and of Fragile-X mental retardation (from B. Oostra’s lab, Rotterdam), with a miniaturized micro-drive developed in-house (Battaglia et al. 2008). </p>
